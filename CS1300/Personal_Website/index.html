        <b>Introduction</b>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Torin. I am excited to share a little bit about
          myself and my journey to Atlas.
        </p>

        <b>Educational Background</b>
        <p>
          My educational journey has been shaped by overcoming challenges
          associated with learning disabilities such as ADHD, dyslexia, and
          autism. These conditions have presented unique hurdles, requiring me
          to develop innovative strategies to succeed academically. Despite
          these challenges, I have remained dedicated to my education, driven by
          a desire to learn new and exciting skills.
          <br />
          Throughout my time in early education, I had to employ various
          techniques to manage my disabilities. For instance, I used specialized
          learning tools and sought additional support from teachers and
          mentors. My journey has been one of persistence, adaptation, and
          resilience, and I have learned to leverage my unique strengths to
          achieve my goals.
        </p>

        <b>Why I Chose This Field of Study</b>
        <p>
          My interest in tech began when I would explore web games at the family
          computer on the weekends. When I was in junior high I spent a few
          weeks at a robotics summercamp. I recall enjoying the process and
          payoff of programming. I was drawn to this field because I love the
          activity of programming and I believe this field with enable life of
          oppurtunity for me. I am particularly interested in developing
          applications that would be run by a user directly because I find that
          having unique, engaging, and accessible tools is empowering to users
          across the web.
        </p>

        <b>Why I Chose This School</b>
        <p>
          Choosing Atlas was a pivotal decision in my academic career. I was
          impressed by the unique study structure and the close bond students of
          all stages have with each other. The commitment to adaptive teaching
          and accessibility aligns perfectly with my personal and academic
          goals. I believe that Atlas offers an environment where I can thrive
          and make meaningful contributions.
        </p>

        <b>My specialization and Why I Chose It</b>
        <p>
          I decided to pursue the Full Stack specialization, or spec, because my
          interest in programming is specifically tailored to user interactions
          and stylish web design. This spec allows me to learn specific skills
          that are directly applicable to projects that align with my interests.
        </p>

        <b>Conclusion</b>
        <p>
          In conclusion, my journey in Programming has been deeply fulfilling,
          and I am eager to continue growing and learning at Atlas. I look
          forward to making the most of the opportunities available and
          contributing to the community.
